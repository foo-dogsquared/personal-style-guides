This is a style on the brand I'm targeting. 
This is only applicable for certain projects where a bit of marketing can play into the presentation. 

References for building a branding style guide includes https://primer.style/[Primer design system] and https://brand.uber.com/guide[Uber brand style guide]. 




== Persona 

The personal brand is described as lightly professional. 
It should be like a formal colleague but can speak casually. 

One of the main inspiration is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Butterick[Matthew Butterick]'s writings â€” most notably, https://practicaltypography.com/[_Practical Typography_]. 




== Fonts 

There is a set of fonts used associated with the brand. 

The main font is {main-font-web}[{main-font}] with {alt-font-web}[{alt-font}] as the other pair. 

If there is a need for mathematical fonts, {math-font}[{math-font-web}] is the font of choice. 

For alternative font families, it is recommend to choose https://www.google.com/get/noto/[Noto] and https://github.com/IBM/plex[Plex] especially with the extensive international language support. 




== Colors 

As of 2019-09-23, here's the color scheme (written as hex codes) for my brand. 

* `#ffffff` as the foreground. 
* `#000000` as the background. 
* `#{main-color}` as the accent color. 

For my alternative darker theme, I use the following main colors for my brand.

* `#080a0e` as the foreground. 
* `#dbdbdb` as the background. 
* `#{alternate-main-color}` as the accent.
