\ProvidesPackage{docs-ifrootdocument}[2019-07-09]

\RequirePackage{standalone}

% Some terminologies:
% root document - The document where it has no parent document (or no 
%                 document that is being imported) at the time of compilation.
% parent document - A document that has an imported document. Take note that the root
%                   document is always a parent document.
% child document - A document that is being imported by the parent document. Only the 
%                  root document is not classified as a child document.

% declaring a new \if macro, setting \rootdocument
\newif\ifrootdocument

% default value will go true since it dictates the doc as a top level or not
% thus, it'll always be true for the top level document
\rootdocumenttrue

% a command for importing files
% NOTE: this must be used for this package to function as it should be, 
%       otherwise, all of the child documents will be considered a root document
\newcommand*\inputchilddocument[1]{%
  \begingroup
    % we simply set the \rootdocument to false for the child instances
    \rootdocumentfalse
