= Personal Style Guides 

A repo where it contains my general personal style guides for various fields such as writing and typography. 

Also serves as my first technical writing project. 




== What is a style guide? 

A style guide is a set of guidelines commonly set for writing, documents, and designs. 
It is used to keep the publications and other files to be consistent and organized. 

There are various style guides for a wide range of topics such as general writing, academic writing, technical writing, codes, design, documentation structure, business writing, and standards creation. 
Here's a list of example style guides for various topics.

Since style guides are usually created to fit the purposes of the company/organization/whoever that made it, it is recommended to create your own. 
Don't worry, it's not that hard (unlike rolling your own license or a cyptographic algorithm). 
All you have to do is to observe how others establish their style guide, cherry-pick their standards that best fitted to your needs, and combine them under your own. 

For personal purposes, think of style guides as your cheatsheet. 




== What topics my personal style guides covers? 

Whatever stuff I find interesting and don't want to deal with future headaches and chaos. 
Primarily, I made one for writing and typography. 
It may expand on that over time. 

You can find them at link:src/[`src/`] directory. 




== Contributing 

You can give feedback simply by shooting me an email or filing an issue on the issue tracker. 
Feel free to argue on what's better or worse. 

You can also make a pull request for wrong spellings or grammar. 
However, don't make a pull request only because you think a certain rule is better (or worse). 




== License 

Feel free to modify as you like as it is released under MIT license.
