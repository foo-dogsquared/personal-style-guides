= Writing style guide

Here's my general style guide for writing for future references. 
As such, this is updated periodically. 

Most of the rules set here are the result of me being lazy and avoiding future migraines. 

This aims to save time on searching, archiving, and editing your document. 
It also enforces consistency with the target persona. 

This writing style guide is based from multiple sources. 
This is mainly inspired from http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/writing.html[_Hints on writing style_], https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/[_A beginnerâ€™s guide to writing documentation_ from "Write the Docs"], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/[_Microsoft Writing Style Guide_], and https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/media_wysiwyg/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide.pdf[_University of Oxford Style Guide_]. 




== Write one sentence per line 

There are no character limits per line enforced but be practical with the limit. 
The https://sembr.org/[Semantic Line Breaks] does not apply here since it is too fuzzy. 
Instead, I'll make it one sentence for all types. 

For clarification, sentences that are connected with a semicolon are considered two sentences. 
They need to be in separated lines. 

In writing with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], there are cases where this particular rule will break. 
In case that the sentence is filled with macros (commonly footnotes) then we apply the semantic line breaks here. 




== Document structure 

Regarding the document itself, it should follow the set guidelines below. 

* The document title should be formatted in sentence case (only capitalize the first word). 
Proper nouns should be capitalized correctly. 
* A revision string should be present in all documents. 
This could be the Git commit hash or the modified datestamp in https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601]. 
* A list of authors. 
* A list of contributors (if the document is open for contributions). 
Since not all documents are applied with Git, the latter is preferred. 
* All types of headers within the document are in sentence case. 
* In case the document will use sectioning numbers, stay with using numbers to easily recognize the hierarchy. 




== Raw source spacing 

While the output may be the same, it is still important for the raw source to be readable. 
Hence, there is a need to space out certain parts of a raw document. 

It will also make it easier to read and maintain the document. 

* If possible, main title (`<h1>` or any equivalent) should be in the first line.
* Headers (`<h2>` or any equivalent) should be preceded by four newlines. 
* All types of subheaders (`<h3>`, ..., `<h6>` or any equivalent) should be preceded by two newlines. 
* There should be a newline before the end of the document. 
* Once a list item contains sublists, the entire list should be spaced out. 




== General style

* Use simple language even in a technical document. 
* Write in informal tone. 
* Write the content in present tense. 
* Ensure sentences are written https://www.grammarly.com/blog/parallelism/[in parallel]. 
* Avert using double negatives (e.g. "not unusual" and "no different"). 
Phrases such as "not less than" are still accepted if it's used mathematically. 
* For introducing abbreviations, write out the full name first then the abbreviation in parenthesis. 
Then you can now use the abbreviated form after. 
* Restrict the number of sentences in each paragraph to have a maximum of 10. 
* Avoid using unit symbols (like `"` for inches) in writing. 
* No emojis! >:-D 
* Emoticons are accepted and should be used sparingly. 




== Text formatting

* Use boldface only for emphasizing. 
* Use italics for referring to a title of a work such as the title of an article, book, audio, or video. 
* Avoid using underlines, strikethroughs, and all caps. 
* Typeblock elements (e.g. paragraphs, images, and equations) should be spaced out in the raw source. 




== Numbers 

* Spell out the numbers 1 to 10. 
If you have multiple numbers in the same sentence, you can use the figures instead. 
* Use appropriate units for the numbers. 
* The same applies for ordinal numbers. 
Spell out 1st to 10th unless you have multiple ordinals. 
* Don't use superscript for ordinal numbers. 
* Strictly write with 24-hour clock (i.e. 10:23, 22:41). 
* Use https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601] to refer to dates and datetime. 




== Lists

* For ordered lists, avoid using roman numerals and letters. 
Only use numbers similarly to sectioning numbers for hierarchy. 
* If a list is introduced as if it's a part of the sentence, punctuate the list items and the connecting sentence correctly. 
Otherwise, start with each list item as if it's another paragraph. 
* Use https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/[serial commas]. 
* Once a list item contains sublists, the entire list should be spaced out in raw source. 
* Avoid using nested lists two levels deep. 




== References 

* For referring to articles, books, videos, audio, and images, the title should be written exactly as they are. 
If the title is stylized (written all uppercase or lowercase, for example), format it in sentence case. 
* Titles should be italicized. 
If it's not possible, enclose them in quotation marks. 
* If you include the author, enclose them in quotation marks. 
* If you want to cite a source similarly to academic writings, use the https://www.bibme.org/citation-guide/apa/[APA citation style]. 
* For bibliography or reference list, use https://www.bibme.org/citation-guide/apa/[APA style] for citations.
